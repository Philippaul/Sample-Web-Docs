<h1>Appeal</h1>
<br>
<p>The general appeal should be very professional. This is supposed to be a company representation to acquire customers.
We try to achieve a clean, modern look for our overall corporate identity and the website should reflect this. There
    should not be much (or non at all) room for experiments. We want to represent what we can provide, mainly by giving
examples (pictures).</p>

<p>Also it is very important to give our sites visitors the possibility to contact us, which means creating a web-site
that does reduce communication hurdles (for example by providing a means of communication within view on each page)</p>

<p>Our color scheme should be something along the line of <a href="colors.html">this proposal.</a></p>

<p>The fonts should be as described <a href="fonts.html">here.</a></p>
